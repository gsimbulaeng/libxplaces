 * \section intro What is xPlaces?
 * eXtensible Places is an open source, multi-platform framework designed to enable interactive applications for several environments. It is primarily concerned with the human aspects of ubiquitous computing, applied to enhance the possible interactions between people and the technologies blended with an ambient. Its main focus is on augmenting and extending everyday life and working activities, implementing services and end-user applications for home automation/entertainment, haptic interfaces and interactive surfaces.
 * \section more Let's live interactive!
 * The purpose of this framework is the design and the development of interactive living/working environment, provided with integrated information and communication technology to best satisfy people needs, thanks to an active and no-invasive synchronized orchestration. The main aim is to give to the “world around us” the role of a medium able to hide technological complexity implicit in everyday objects and to make easier people activities encouraging interaction with services and applications. xPlaces framework not only allows the development of specific ready-to-use products, but it also sets up a technological platform comprising device, network and computer programme standardized components allowing for a simple creation of services adapted to different needs and environments spanning office, clinic, factory, museum, metropolitan area, and the global environment. Interaction with them becomes implicit and natural according to people preferences. The eXtended Places could easily and naturally integrate devices ranging from tiny sensors and actuators to hand-held information appliances, able to configure, install, diagnose, maintain, and improve themselves. Such technology enables data collection and processing in a variety of situations, for applications, which include environmental monitoring, context-aware personal assistants, home automation and entertainment, interactive showcase and so on.
 *
 * \section install Installation
 * \subsection step1 Step 1: Download the framework
 * Download the sorces package ".tar.gz" right here \htmlonly <a href="">sources</a>\endhtmlonly
 * \subsection step2 Step 2: Compile the library
 * Extract the sources and call the contained makefile by executing \code make libxplaces \endcode or \code make all \endcode
 * \subsection step3 Step 3: Add the library path.
 * Once compiled, add the path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH and you're ready to use xplaces.
